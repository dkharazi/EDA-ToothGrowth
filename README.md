We're going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

### Table of Contents

1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
2. Provide a basic summary of the data.
3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)
4. State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.

### Description

There are two general hypotheses that we believe to be true:    
1. We believe that there are not generally different tooth lengths for each type of supplement.    
2. We believe that there are not generally different tooth lengths for each level of dose. 

### Conclusion

Based on a 95% confidence interval, we decide to reject the null hypotheses and prefer the alternative hypotheses, since each p-value is extremely small. In other words, we believe that there are generally different tooth lengths for each type of supplement, and we believe that there are generally different tooth lengths for each level of dose.
